But it's surprising, to the touch. \nIt feels like it adapts perfectly to your hands, as if it is... alive. It is not cold nor rigid. \nIt is extremely hard though, and it resists all of your attempts at sctratching it. \n\nYou shrug your shoulders, and you move on to inspect the blade. \n\nThe blade is double-edged, and this looks weird to you because it is also slightly curved. \nIt's four fingers wide at the intersection with the guard,\nthen it spreads outward with an arc on each side reaching about a handbreadth. \nThe width decreases towards the point. And the point looks strange: it is oddly asymmetrical,\nas if the blacksmith wanted to make it look as a broken, splintered blade, that was later resharped as a razor. \n\nYou think it's impossible to fight with a weapon like that. \nNonetheless, when you wield it you feel as your arm is one thing with the sword,\nand it does not looks like you and the sword move in a clumsy or unbalanced way at all. \n\nThe metal of the blade itself looks strange. It reflects the light unevenly,\nand you don't know why but you think it's like its molecular structure is constantly shifting. \nSometimes you can see your own image reflected on the blade as a mirror;\nyet a second after the reflection seems to swim or evaporate in different directions,\nas if it is subject to a sudden and impossible turbulence. \nIf you keep on staring at it, the blade looks like it's subtly moving back and forth,\nlike a living thing, even if it's cold and solid to the touch. \n\nAs if all of that isn't enough, you also feel like you can glimpse an inscription flowing along its entire lenght. \nBut it's more a feeling than an actual visual input.
