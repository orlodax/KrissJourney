In the front, the Chief in his jeep. \nHorses loaded with weapons and men form clouds of dust, galloping spurred by their riders. \n\nYou are in the rearguard, sharing a horse with Smiurl. Corolla and Theo are right ahead. \n\nYou never thought riding could be so frustrating. \nYou fear that when you'll get back on the ground# (if you will ever do),\nsomeone will have to very mercifully put all of your pieces back together. \nYou feel every jolt in your bones; your ears are full of the shouts coming from that bunch of... \nYou don't even know $Wwhat$C they are. \n\nAnd what about Smiurl's own shouts?# Uncomprehensible noise. \n\n\nAfter what it feels like an eternity to you, that mess starts to wane. \nThe horses slow down, ending up scattered along the edge of a canyon. \nIt quite suddenly cuts everybody off. A long wound scarring the wide, rocky, semi-desert, plain.",
