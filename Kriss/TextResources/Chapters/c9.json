She must have been to your side the whole time. \nShe's asleep now. Must be exhausted. Seeing her this way, she looks so vulnerable... You feel very thankful. \n\nYou carefully walk around her, trying not to stumble and to be quiet in order to not wake her up. \nOnce outside, the light blinds you, causing renewed pain to your head. \n\nIt is morning, and Math and Theo are busy around the bonfire, now turned to ashes and embers. \nYou reach them and sit, suddenly feeling weak and... $cempty$C.",
